# Random-Tree
A point will move at a certain angle and will leave a trace.
There is a random chance for a new point with randomly simular angle to appear from another point.
A point has a certain lifespan and when it runs out the point disappears.
If there is only one point left, it will not die.
If there are too many points all points die.
A creepy tree is formed.
Enjoy!
